INTRODUCTION
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory.

What is an Array of Pointers to String

Pointers contain addresses of the particular variable that we need. An array of pointers stores the addresses of all the elements of the array and an array of string pointers stores the addresses of the strings present in the array. The array contains the base address of every String element in the array.

A String is a data type that stores the sequence of characters in an array. A string in C always ends with a null character (\0), which indicates the termination of the string
