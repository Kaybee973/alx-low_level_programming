What is Recursion in C?
First, letâ€™s start with the recursion definition,

Recursion is the process of calling a function itself repeatedly until a particular condition is met. A function that calls itself directly or indirectly is called a recursive function and such kind of function calls are called recursive calls.

In C, recursion is used to solve a complex problem. Using recursion we can solve a complex problem in a small piece of code by breaking down the problem. We can solve large numbers of problems using recursion for example factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, generating subsets etc.
