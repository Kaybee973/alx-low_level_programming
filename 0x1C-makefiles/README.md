If you want to run or update a task when certain files are updated, the make utility can come in handy. The make utility requires a file, Makefile (or makefile), which defines set of tasks to be executed. You may have used make to compile a program from source code. Most open source projects use make to compile a final executable binary, which can then be installed using make install.

In this article, we'll explore make and Makefile using basic and advanced examples. Before you start, ensure that make is installed in your system.
